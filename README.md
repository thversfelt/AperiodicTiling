# Aperiodic Tiling 

A common technique for texturing large planes is to periodically tile a single texture, which often results in noticeable and distracting periodic patterns. Aperiodic Tiling is a Unity surface shader that removes these noticeable tiling patterns by implementing a state-of-art stochastic tiling system as introduced in the paper by [Cohen et al](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/Fall19/Readings/Cohen03.pdf). 

## Features

- Normal mapping support
- Adjustable Level-of-Detail (LOD)
- Demo scene
- Two example tilesets (basic and flowers)
- Clean, well-documented code
