# Aperiodic Tiling 

A common technique for texturing large planes is to periodically tile a single texture, which often results in noticeable and distracting periodic patterns. The Aperiodic Tiling plugin contains a Unity surface shader that removes these noticeable tiling patterns by implementing a state-of-art stochastic tiling system as introduced in the paper by [Cohen et al](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/Fall19/Readings/Cohen03.pdf). 

## Features

- Pattern generator to generate random tilings
- Normal mapping support
- Adjustable Level-of-Detail (LOD)
- Demo scene
- Three example tilesets (basic, flowers and rocks)
- Easy to use user-interface
- Clean, well-documented code

## Usage

The following [tutorial video](https://youtu.be/zU1IxlMyJv8) shows how to use Rob Burke's [Wang tiler](https://robburke.net/mle/wang/) to create a new custom tileset from a single source image.
